### 📜 Prepare an Intro 

This is how you set the tone for the interview and get any important achievements across, it should be no longer than 2-3 minutes and you can use it in all interviews. The more you use this the better it gets 

###  ❔ Why do this?
- Selling ourselves is often a hard thing for many and can turn into rambling/waffling/jargon
- Share achievements and outcomes, to help the interviewer focus on what you are good at
- It helps the interviewer get to know you personally, we aren't robots 🤖

### 😎 What to do? 
Got to your note taking app and jot down:
- Personal things about you - it could be where your originally from/why you got into your line of work/education - This is your opening line
- Bullet points about your career journey - the companies you worked at, gaps in your CV, carreer changes
- Any projects you are proud of - this can also be a current project, think about outcomes you helped achieve. These should be small snippets that you can elaborate on during your session
- Things about your family/hobbies/interests/passions
- Closing sentence to pass back to the interviewer e.g. And that's me!

### ⏳ Next step... Putting it together
Get a timer out. Look at your notes and practise out loud telling your story. It's harder than you think! You will likely need to go over this a few times and refine your notes to help prompt you telling the story

### 💡 Finally
Ask a friend/family member/recruiter to try it out on
